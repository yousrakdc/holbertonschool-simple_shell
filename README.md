# Simple Shell Project

This is our end-of-trimester project, part of our Holberton School formation.
This project was completed using C language Shell Betty linter.

## What's a Shell?

It's a command-line interface program that provides users with a way to interact with the operating system by accepting and executing commands. It acts as an intermediary between the user and the kernel of the operating system, facilitating tasks such as launching programs, managing files, and controlling system resources.
